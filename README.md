# Yu-Gi-Oh-Companion-App
The Yu-Gi-Oh Companion App is an application designed to be used when playing the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.

You can also add player details to the application as well, such as your name, your current number of wins, your current number of matches, your friend code for the online game Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links and your friend code for the other online game Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel. This app features backgrounds, fonts and sound effects from the original Yu-Gi-Oh anime.
